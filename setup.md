## Software
This lesson assumes you have current versions of [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed on your computer. R is installed automatically as a part of RStudio.

R `tidyverse` will be installed as a part of the lesson, but if you would like to have it ready before you start, you can install it yourself. To do so, follow the following instructions:

1.  Open RStudio
2.  Enter `install.packages("tidyverse")` into the console and press enter.
3.  Installation may take several minutes to finish, wait until you see a `>` prompt with a blinking cursor in the console before closing RStudio.

You also need to download the dataset that will be used in this lesson. It can be found [here](wut), right-click on the link, click on `Save Link as...`, and save the file to a location where you can find it.
