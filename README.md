R tidyverse for Reproducible Data Analysis
==============

This repository contains the files used to build the lesson pages in the *R tidyverse for Reproducible Data Analysis* workshop materials. Please see <https://jmastough.github.io/tidyverse-workshop/> for a rendered version of this material.

R is a free software environment developed to perform statistical analysis and visualize data that has expanded over more than 2 decades of development to become a major platform for software development and distribution. One of the more prominent packages developed for R, `tidyverse`, is actually a collection of 8 different packages that help to simplify the process of data analysis in R. 

The goal of this course is to teach novice programmers how to use `tidyverse` in R to import, process, transform, manupulate, and ultimately visualize data. This course is designed to be taught in 2 half-day sessions as a part of a 2-day Software Carpentry workshop, about 6 hours in total. While this is not nearly enough time to explore all of the myriad functions included in `tidyverse`, it will walk learners through the basics of data analysis and visualization, and establish a foundation for future education and practice.

For a more detailed description of the capabilities of R `tidyverse`, check out the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) written and made freely available online by its creators.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their usability.
