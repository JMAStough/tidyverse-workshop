R is a free software environment developed to perform statistical analysis and visualize data that has expanded over more than 2 decades of development to become a major platform for software development and distribution. One of the more prominent packages developed for R, `tidyverse`, is actually a collection of 8 different packages that help to simplify the process of data analysis in R. 

The goal of this course is to teach novice programmers how to use `tidyverse` in R to import, process, transform, manupulate, and ultimately visualize data. This course is designed to be taught in 2 half-day sessions as a part of a 2-day Software Carpentry workshop, about 6 hours in total. While this is not nearly enough time to explore all of the myriad functions included in `tidyverse`, it will walk learners through the basics of data analysis and visualization, and establish a foundation for future education and practice.

For a more detailed description of the capabilities of R `tidyverse`, check out the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) written and made freely available online by its creators.
